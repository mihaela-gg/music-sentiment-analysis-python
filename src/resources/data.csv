I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs, Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying, Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here. I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors, I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?

I think about the things I would never got to say to you, I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do. Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too, I still love your mother, that'll never change, Think about her every day, we just could never get it together. Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it, But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on anyday. There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains, Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain. But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame, I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint. I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history, But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say, I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way. But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..  I'm going through changes Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

24,Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas),regina spektor,220,positive,"Down on Bowery they lose their Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night, And stumbling through the street they say, ""Sir, do you got a light?"" And if you do then you're my friend, And if you don't then you're my foe, And if you are a deity of any sort Then please don't go.  Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas  And down on Lexington they're wearing New shoes stuck to aging feet, And close their eyes and open, And not recognize the aging street, And think about how things were right When they were young and veins were tight And if you are the ghost of Christmas Past Then won't you stay the night?  Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas Ne me quitte pas, mon chere Ne me quitte pas  Down in Bronxy-Bronx the kids go Sledding down snow-covered slopes And frozen noses, frozen toes The frozen city starts to glow And yes, they know that it'll melt And yes, the know New York will thaw But if you are a friend of any sort Then play along and catch a cold!

I see the things You do through me As great things I have done And now You gently break me, Then lovingly You take me  And hold me as my Father and mold me as my Maker. I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you. And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace  At times I may grow weak and feel a bit discouraged, Knowing that someone, somewhere Could do a better job. For who am I to serve You? I know I don't deserve You. And that's the part that burns in my heart And keeps me hanging on I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace you are so Patient with me, Lord.  As I work with You, I'm learning what Your grace really means. The price that I could never pay was paid at Calvary. So, instead of trying to repay You, I'm learning to simply obey You By giving up my life to You For all that giving to me I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you. And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace.""  "

56,Shades Of Gray,The Monkees,199,positive,"When the world and I were young, Just yesterday.  Life was such a simple game, A child could play.  It was easy then to tell right from wrong. Easy then to tell weak from strong. When a man should stand and fight, Or just go along.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. I remember when the answers seemed so clear  We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear. It was easy then to tell truth from lies Selling out from compromise Who to love and who to hate,  The foolish from the wise.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. [Instumental interlude]  It was easy then to know what was fair When to keep and when to share. How much to protect your heart And how much to care. But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. Only shades of gray. "

Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, Iâve never felt so at home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When weâre apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish weâd fall in love?

There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  "

A reflection of a lie will keep me waiting. With love gone for so long.  And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know. Knowing that faith is all that I hold.  Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding. Fall into your sunlight. BY ç£ç³ç§ç¦ "

8,A Thousand Kisses Deep,Leonard Cohen,386,positive,"The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat. You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. You lose your grip, and then you slip Into the Masterpiece. And maybe I had miles to drive, And promises to keep: You ditch it all to stay alive, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  Confined to sex, we pressed against The limits of the sea: I saw there were no oceans left For scavengers like me. I made it to the forward deck. I blessed our remnant fleet And then consented to be wrecked, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. I guess they won't exchange the gifts That you were meant to keep. And quiet is the thought of you, The file on you complete, Except what we forgot to do, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat...
