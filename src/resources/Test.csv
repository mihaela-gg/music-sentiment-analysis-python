Easy then to tell weak from strong. When a man should stand and fight, Or just go along.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. I remember when the answers seemed so clear  We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear. It was easy then to tell truth from lies Selling out from compromise Who to love and who to hate,  The foolish from the wise.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. [Instumental interlude]  It was easy then to know what was fair When to keep and when to share. How much to protect your heart And how much to care. But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. Only shades of gray. "

A reflection of a lie will keep me waiting. With love gone for so long.  And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know. Knowing that faith is all that I hold.

I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping, still my guitar, gently weeps. I don't know why, nobody told you, how to unfold your love.  I don't know how, someone controlled you, they bought and sold you. I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning, while my guitar, gently weeps. With every mistake, we must surely, be learning, still my guitar, gently weeps  I don't know how, you were diverted, you were perverted, too. I don't know how, you were inverted, no one alerted you. I look, at you all, see the love, there that's sleeping, while my guitar, gently weeps. Look at you all...  Still my guitar, gently weeps.  "

95,Windmills Of Your Mind,Sting,259,positive,"round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival baloon like a carousel that's turning, running rings around the moon like a clock whose hands are sweeping, past the minutes of it's face and the world is like an apple, whirling silently in space like the circles that you find, in the windmills of your mind.  to a tunnel of its own. down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgooten dream or the ripple from the pebble someone tosses in a stream like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space like the circles that you find, in the windmills of your mind.  keys that jungle in your rocket, words that jangle in your head. why did summer go so quickly? was it something that you said? lovers walk along the shore, and leave their foot prints in the sand. is the sound of distant drumming, just the fingers of your hand? pictures hanging in a hallway, and the fragment of a song half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong? when you knew that is was over, you were suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the colour of his hair. round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel as the images unwind, like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind. music ^_^  æææç¤¼åç° "
